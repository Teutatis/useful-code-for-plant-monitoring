# How-To-Tutorials - Jeremy Blythe 16 Aug 2013

# Synopsis: Read an analogue value from an MCP3008 chip and display it via the console.

# This program improves the display to the console.
# Rather than print the value out to the screen in a scrolling window, this script will create a dashboard effect.
# Each sensor reading is written over the top of the last so your window doesn’t scroll.

# Also red, yellow and green backgrounds are used as traffic light highlights.
# When the soil is well watered the background will be green. When it is too dry it’ll show red.

# To achieve this colouring, special ANSI escape codes are used to send commands to the console.
# Each escape code sequence starts with \x1b[ followed by the command codes to produce an effect.

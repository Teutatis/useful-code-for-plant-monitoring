# A simple piece of code to read the value of an LDR using a capacitor and gpiozero library.

# https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/ldr

# Hardware connections:
# 1) Connect one leg of the LDR to the 3V3 pin.
# 2) Connect the short leg (should have a negative stripe on the body) of a 1ÂµF capacitor to a ground pin.
# 3) Connect the other leg of the LDR and the other long leg of the capacitor to the same GPIO pin

from gpiozero import LightSensor, Buzzer

  ldr = LightSensor(4)  # alter if using a different pin
  while True:
      print(ldr.value)
